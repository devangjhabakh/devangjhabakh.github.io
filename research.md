I currently work as Undergradute Research Assistant at the Berkeley [RISE](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/)/[Sky](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) Lab. I work with Sarah Wooders on her feature stores distributed systems project, RALF.

Prior to this, I'd undertaken an independent research project in the domain of Machine Learning & Systems too: [Learning Slab Classes to Alleviate Memory Holes in Memcached](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04403)
